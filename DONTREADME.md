# Rust Fly Swatters

## Why?

I'm curious about Rust, and I've some problems that I think are approachable enough in complexity, and annoying enough to warrant solving in Rust.


## Usage

It is likely that each script in this repo will be logically self-contained, and as such, `cargo run <SCRIPT.rs>` is all you'll need to do. This repo assumes  that the user executes the scripts from a UNIX or UNIX-like operating system.


## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Add a new fly swatter, scrutinize code and expand the repo's utility!
